API Proxy module
=============

The API Proxy module enables a teacher to create a Moodle connector which allows to create remote services hosted by Moodle itself and to calculate and display usage statistics for these services - whether they are hosted by Moodle itself or on other remote servers. 

*This would allow these statistics to be incorporated into the rating system.
